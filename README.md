McAPI
=====

McAPI is a simple utlitity to get information about Minecraft server. It
will return a lot of information. - McAPI will support a lot of differet
versions (1.8.x [should be done], 1.7.x [done], 1.7.10 [done], 1.6 [done]). I use it in my own projects (e.g. http://mcapi.sweetcode.de) in the next weaks I will add more functions like Votifier-Vote, Avatars, UUID-Support and more awesome stuff based on my old project. When you have ideas you can send me a pull-request or a message. When I like your idea and when I thing that your idea is usefull than I will add it to the project and I will list your name in this read-me. 

When you use this script, then backlink me on your project site because it's my work and I want some feedback.

Stay tuned for more awesome stuff.
